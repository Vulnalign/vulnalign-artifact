# VulnAlign Artifact (Anonymous Submission)

This repository contains the code, sample data, and configuration files used to support the anonymous submission titled **VulnAlign**.  
The artifact demonstrates the dataset construction pipeline for:

- Linking CVEs to vulnerable and patched code
- Validating labels using static (rule-based) analysis
- Reconciling CWEs using ontology-aware reasoning

The repository is structured to allow reviewers to inspect the methodology and reproduce a small-scale version of the pipeline using the included samples.

```
Note: The full VulnAlign dataset is several gigabytes in size and is not included in this repository.
Instead, we provide two representative samples that match the schema and processing stages described in the paper.

📄 Dataset Samples

1. DATA/master_validated_dataset.jsonl
  - JSONL file (one JSON object per line).
  - Contains the full Semgrep validation output for a sample of vulnerability–fix pairs.

It includes (field names may be abbreviated in practice):

  - CVE and repository metadata (e.g., cve_id, repo_url, commit_sha)
  - Vulnerable / patched code identifiers (e.g., original_filename, file paths)
  -Semgrep match information:

      - high-precision / extended-precision counts (HP/EP)
      - rule identifiers
  - Flags for mismatches / noisy examples
  -Intermediate validation metadata used to derive the final dataset

This file is intended to illustrate the complete validation output, including both “good” and “noisy” cases, so reviewers can see how Semgrep and filtering operate.


2. DATA/unique_validated_dataset_for_review.jsonl

  - JSONL file (one JSON object per line).
  - Contains only validated examples (HP/EP), i.e. high-confidence matches after filtering.

Compared to master_validated_dataset.jsonl, this file:

  - Excludes noisy / mismatched entries
  - Keeps only the unique, validated vulnerability–fix pairs that pass the filtering criteria
  - Reflects the clean subset used for experiments in the paper

This file is intended for quick inspection and for understanding the final dataset structure without noise.



Code Overview (Inspection-Oriented)

The code is organized so that reviewers can trace each stage of the pipeline. Running everything end-to-end is not required and may be impractical (external APIs, runtime), but the logic is fully visible.

CODE/mining/

Contains notebooks and scripts used to:

 - Download CVE data from NVD

 - Resolve references to repositories and commits

- Extract vulnerable and patched code from version control history

These scripts depend on NVD dumps and external Git hosting (e.g., GitHub) and are not expected to be re-run during artifact review.

CODE/validation/

Contains notebooks and scripts used to:
  
  - Run Semgrep on candidate vulnerability–fix pairs
  - Compute EP/HP metrics
  - Flag mismatches and noisy examples

This code is responsible for producing the kinds of results seen in master_validated_dataset.jsonl.

CODE/ontology_scripts/

Contains notebooks and scripts used to:

  - Reason over the CWE hierarchy

  - Reconcile high-level / abstract CWEs with more specific CWE categories

  - Produce the reconciled labels used in the final dataset

sanitize.py

Utility helper for:

  - Cleaning notebooks or exported files

  - Normalizing formats before committing / sharing
